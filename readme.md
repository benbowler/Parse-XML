## Parse XML Class in PHP

####Works great with iTunes XML feeds

 * Function by Gaarf http://gaarf.info/2009/08/13/xml-string-to-php-array/
 * Made into a class by Ben Bowler: http://benbowler.com

I created this class to parse itunes xml podcast feeds in Codeigniter. This class takes a string containing xml and returns an array of all elements including namespaces. Will update as needed.
